# Nibbleblog-BruteForce
Nibbleblog is a CMS that has the peculiarity of blocking the IP address that attempts to log in after 5 failed login requests. To prevent this, the X-Forwarded-For header and a random IP generator are used in this script.

The login panel URL, dictionary and user to bruteforce (admin as default) should be modified if necessary.
